The Unitarian Church
In 1994, based on a contract of use, the local council offered the Unitarian congregation 10 ares of land in the so-called Rose Garden for the construction of a church on the present Rózsa street (strada Trandafirilor).
The foundation stone of the church designed by Gábor Bíró, an architect from Târgu Mureș, was laid on this site on 30 June, 1994. The construction of the church was carried out under the stewardship of pastor Sándor Balázs and György Incze. The church was consecrated on 15 October 1995. In 1999, the congregation decided to build a tower with a separate base, different from the original plan. Thus, based on the plans of the architect Lóránt Bakó, they started to build a 17-meter-high tower at the entrance of the church, with a floor area of 9 square meters. The tower was completed in 2001.
