Csiki Mill
The history of the mill begins in 1912 when it is built by Váradi Béla. In 1916, he sold it to Csiki Dénes, a miller.
The construction of the mill can be divided into two phrases. In the first, the mill house and the engine room was built. In the second phrase, the mill room was expanded and the upper part of the engine room is rebuilt. In the beginning, the milling mechanism was composed by a roller and a millstone. After 1930, it was extended to two rollers and two millstones. The mechanism was activated by a 35-horsepower engine constructed by the Magyar Motor és Gépgyár R.T./Mayer Gépgyár, Vas- és Fémöntöde in Szombathely. The engine was powered by coal gas. In June 1948, the mill was nationalized, and at this time, it was able to process 15 tons of forage in 24 hours.
After 95 years, the mill was shut down and closed in 2007.
