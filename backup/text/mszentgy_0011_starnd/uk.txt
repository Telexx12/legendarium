The Salt Water Baths of Sângeorgiu de Mureş:
The Salt Water Baths of Sângeorgiu de Mureş, renowned for its saltwater and mineral mud, has been known since 1880 when, a salt water pool fed from a surface spring was used for the first time. The first written mention, which highlights the therapeutic qualities of the salt baths dates back to 1900, when two salt water pools and cabins, a restaurant with rental rooms and a park were in use. In 1902 the festive opening of salt baths was organized, which included bicycle rides, carriage and wagon rides, artistic programs and sports competitions. This information appeared in the local press, in the “Székely Lapok” newspaper.
The first well was drilled at a depth of 864 meters in 1912. In the 1960s and 1970s, two more salt water wells were drilled to a depth of 799 and 915 meters. Between 1920 and 1924, three saltwater bath pools, as well as cabins and a beach, a thermal water treatment complex, individual bath tubs, mineral mud packs, a restaurant and a park for relaxation were built.

In 1938 a hotel with 12 rooms and a doctor’s office was built. In this location, between 1971-1983 there was a physiotherapy hospital with 24 beds and also a doctor’s office. Until 1924, the salt water baths were the property of Mr. Csete Bela, and then ownership was transferred to the General House of Economies from Sibiu until 1948. Since 1948, they have been owned by the Romanian State.
