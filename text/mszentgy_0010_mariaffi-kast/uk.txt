The Máriaffi castle
In the 15th century, the site of the castle was the residence of the Szentgyörgyi family; from the 16th century it is known as the residence of the Tóth family. From the 17th century, the castle was the residence of the Petki family and was visited by several important Transylvanian personalities, such as the Prince of Transylvania, attending the wedding of Todalagi Mihály and Petki Erzsébet. Count Sigismund Kornis, the governor of Transylvania was also present at the wedding.
The castle in its present form was built in 1870 by the Máriaffi family, featuring elements in the Neoclassical and Empire styles. Construction was completed with extraordinary costs, and craftsmen and architects from Vienna were brought to work on decorating it. The park had an impressive arboretum, ornamental bushes, flowers and a lake of about 7 hectares.
The members of the Máriaffi family were nobles of the royal household. The family was well-known in the Mureș area because they were the first to organize horse races here.
The last member of the Máriaffi family, Máriaffi Lajos and his wife, Wesselényi Erzsébet, together with their 2 children, Ilona and Antal, fled the castle in 1946 upon the arrival of the Russian army. After the Second World War, the castle was nationalized and it was used as a research center: it hosted the most prominent agrotechnical research center in Romania. From 1990, the building was used by the Gendarmerie until 2000. After that, the castle and the property were returned to the owner. Máriaffi Antal, the last heir of the Mariaffi family decided to sell the castle to the local council in 2010. The local council’s first step to save the castle was to rebuilt its roof destroyed by the weather. The restoration work of the castle started in 2019 and it was finished in 2021. In the future, the castle will also function as a cultural and tourist center.
