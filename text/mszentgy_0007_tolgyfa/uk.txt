The Máriaffi park
The park is placed in the front of the Máriaffi castle and it is realized in the style of English gardens. The park was created to protect the castle. The trees were planted alongside the winding road, until 1962, when a storm destroyed most of the trees. After that the trees were replanted in a straight line. In the park we can find the following trees: tilia, Quercus lyrata, nutmeg, acacia, maple, chestnut, yew tree, cornel tree.
