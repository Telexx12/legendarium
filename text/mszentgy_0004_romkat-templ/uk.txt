The Roman Catholic church
The Church dates back to the 13th century: this is proven by the semicircular apse of the sanctuary and the beautiful Romanesque windows which have resisted in time, with many Gothic accents, being a perfect combination between the two styles.
The nave was built in 1442, the tower dates from 1823. The wave of Reformation arrives in the settlement in 1572, the church is used by the Protestants until 1720 when count Petki DÃ¡vid takes back the church and it is reconstructed. The sanctuary is rebuilt in the Gothic-Romanesque style, the ceiling is remade using coffer-work. The altar features the fresco of St. George. The two sanctuaries and the amphitheatre with pointed arches are built in 1720. The pulpit with a groin vault is placed in the left part of the nave.
