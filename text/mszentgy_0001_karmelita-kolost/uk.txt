The Carmelite monastery of Sângeorgiu de Mureș, named after Saint Therese of Lisieux

The foundation of the monastery dates back to 1997, when the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Alba Iulia, Dr. György Jakubinyi invited the Carmelites from Pécs, Hungary to establish a monastery in Transylvania. In 2001, a small group of Carmelite sisters arrived to look for a suitable site for the new convent. The final decision on the location was made in 2004 – the sisters chose Sângeorgiu de Mureș. The foundation of the monastery was laid in 2005. The monastery was consecrated in 2006. In addition to an intense prayer life, the sisters are also involved in candle decoration and bookbinding. At present, five sisters from Transylvania and one from Hungary serve in the monastery. The monastery offers a retreat from the world for all who wish to find peace, either individually or in small groups.
