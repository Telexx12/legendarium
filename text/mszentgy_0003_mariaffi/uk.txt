The Máriaffi Chapel
The Máriaffi Chapel was built in 1700 by the Petki family from Marosszentgyörgy, and it was named Szentkereszt kápolna (The Chapel of the Holy Cross). When the last member of the Petki family died, the chapel was taken over by the Máriaffi family from Marosszentgyörgy, and this is why it is now known as the Máriaffi Chapel. Around the chapel, several gravestones of nobles from Marosszentgyörgy and Ernye can be found.
